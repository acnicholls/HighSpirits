# HighSpirits
# Origin
College Project
# Premise
The majority of the project was pre-written, it was in a mostly working state when handed to us. The "previous programmers" had left part way through the project and we were to use the existing code and make it work.
# Architecture
The project is written entirely in Visual Basic 6, and uses text files to store data.  Reports are sent directly to the default printer, and layouts are in code.
# Downloading
Grab the zip from the release, and extract.  Run the HighSpirits.exe file.
# Logging in
Once you've extracted the files, go into the Data folder and open the Users.dat file, the username is the first entry in quotes, and the password is the last entry on the same line.  Users with an A in quotes before the password have admin rights and can edit users.
